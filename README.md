# envpicker

A simple CLI tool for managing multiple environment files in your Node.js projects.

## Overview

envpicker helps developers easily manage and switch between different environment files (`.env`) in their local development environment. It provides simple commands to initialize, list, activate, and delete environment configurations.

## Installation

Install globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g envpicker
```

Or use directly with npx:

```bash
npx envpicker [command]
```

## Usage

### Available Commands

```bash
envpicker [command]

Commands:
  list | ls               List all available environments
  activate | use [env]    Switch to specified environment
  save [env]              Save current .env to /env directory
  deactivate | stop       Remove active environment
  init                    Initialize default environment files
  delete [env]            Delete specific environment file
```

### Basic Operations

1. Initialize default environment files:
```bash
envpicker init
```
This will create:
- `env/.env.development`
- `env/.env.staging`
- `env/.env.production`

2. List available environments:
```bash
envpicker list
```

3. Activate an environment:
```bash
envpicker activate development
```

4. Deactivate current environment:
```bash
envpicker deactivate
```

5. Delete an environment:
```bash
envpicker delete development
```

6. Save an environment:
```bash
envpicker save development
```

## File Structure

The tool expects your project to have the following structure:

```
your-project/
├── env/
│   ├── .env.development
│   ├── .env.staging
│   └── .env.production
├── .env (created when environment is activated)
└── package.json
```

## Requirements
